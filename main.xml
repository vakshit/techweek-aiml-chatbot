  <pattern>SYMPTOMS</pattern>
  <template>
  The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and
dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal
congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are
usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but
don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people
(about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special
treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19
becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people,
and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure,
heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.
People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical
attention.

  <pattern>FROM WHERE DID COVID ORIGINATE</pattern>
  <template>Currently, the source of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus (CoV) causing COVID-19 is unknown. 
  All available evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has a natural animal origin and is not a constructed virus.
   SARS-CoV-2 virus most probably has its ecological reservoir in bats. SARS-CoV-2, belongs to a group of genetically 
   related viruses, which also include SARS-CoV and a number of other CoVs isolated from bats populations. MERS-CoV 
   also belongs to this group, but is less closely related.

  <pattern>CAN COVID 19 BE CURED</pattern>
  <template>While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide
comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence
that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. We does not
recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics,
as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several
ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional
medicines. We will continue to provide updated information as soon
as clinical findings are available

Those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should
be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care. 
Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under
investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials.
The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against
COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with
the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1
meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing

Please go to your nearest hospital for check-up in case of any covid related symptoms.

  <pattern>HOW DOES COVID 19 SPREAD</pattern>
  <template>People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The
disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from
the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19
coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces
around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching
these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a
person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is
why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a
person who is sick.

  <pattern>HOW LONG THE VIRUS SURVIVES ON SURFACES</pattern>
  <template>
  It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on
surfaces, but it seems to behave like other corona viruses. Studies
suggest that corona viruses (including preliminary information on the
COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to
several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of
surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).
If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant
to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with 
an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid
touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.

  <template>
  No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on
bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do
not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or
treatment of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a
physician to treat a bacterial infection.

  <pattern>HOW TO PUT ON AND DISCARD MASK</pattern>
  <template>1. Remember, a mask should only be used by health workers, care takers,
and individuals with respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough.
2. Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based
hand rub or soap and water.
3. Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes.
4. Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is).
5. Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the
coloured side).
6. Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of
the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose.
7. Pull down the mask’s bottom so it covers your mouth and your
chin.
8. After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from
behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face
and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces
of the mask.
9. Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use.
10. Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the
mask – Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash
your hands with soap and water.</template>

  <template>Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for
children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness:
about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is
therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19
outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.
We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our
loved ones and our communities. First and foremost among these
actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory
hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local
health authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel,
movement and gatherings. </template>

  <template>While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people,
older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such
as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or
diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others</template>

  <pattern>* SARS *</pattern>
  <template>The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the
outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are
related to each other genetically, but the diseases they cause are
quite different.
SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19.
There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since
2003.</template>

  <pattern>* PET *</pattern>
  <template>While there has been one instance of a dog being infected in Hong
Kong, to date, there is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can
transmit COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets
produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. To
protect yourself, clean your hands frequently and thoroughly.
We continues to monitor the latest research on this and other COVID19 topics and will update as new findings are available. </template>
